# SAA-C03-Dumps-PDF
I passed my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03 Exam few months before. I had prepared for my exam with the help of different Youtube channels and a SAA-C03 Dumps PDF Guide from itexamshub.

1: You-tube Channels:
I used to watch videos from channels peace of code & cloud vikings. Both the channels helps me in clearing my basic concepts for different topics of the exam. It was really fruitful for me.

2: SAA-C03 Practice Test:

I also used a practice guide from itexamshub. The guide helps me to have a look what type of questions will appear in the exam. About 85% of the questions were same as I prepared in the SAA-C03 Practice Test.
